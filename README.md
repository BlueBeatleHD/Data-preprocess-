This is a small starter data cleaning and preprocessing script using python. The script reads a CSV file containing the raw data, drops rows with missing values, removes duplicate rows, and standardizes specified columns to lower case. The cleaned data is then saved to a new CSV file. 

Before you run the script, make sure to change the file path specified within the code itself.
